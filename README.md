# htools4ubuntu || # hacker-tools-for-ubuntu
there are times where I need to make a quick ubuntu usb bootbale image, or partition an ubuntu image to disk (overwriting old windows pc's), and so rather than going through the tedious process of installing all the hackertools/programs I love, I decided to automate it.

requirement: ubuntu_tools_list.txt (in its format - with 8 "-'s")

automated - program which installs tools i like to have on my ubuntu platform(s)
